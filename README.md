Instagram Data Collection Script
This script collects user data from Instagram, including their followers and subscriptions, and saves the data to text files. It also creates a directory for each user's data and saves the files to that directory.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following installed:

1.Python 3

2.InstagramAPI library 
```bash
pip install InstagramAPI
```

### Usage

 Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limybox2016/instagramstalker/
```
 Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

```bash
cd C:\Users\limybox2016\Documents\GitHub\instagram stalker
```
Replace the data in the file collect.py (line 13)
```bash
py collect.py

```

 Once done, we will get the start of the countdown of our program and from this point we will track new subscribers.

 We create a folder with username_data

 There we also get a file Progress.py, which we can run after we run collect.py

```bash
cd C:\Users\limybox2016\Documents\GitHub\instagram stalker\{username}_data\

py Progress.py
```

Succeceful!
